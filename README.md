This was one of my first experiences designing a complete database system. While the implementation reflects my early-stage skills, it demonstrates fundamental database concepts including:
- Normalized table design
- Transaction processing
- View-based reporting
- Trigger automation

The project was developed collaboratively using Git for version control.
